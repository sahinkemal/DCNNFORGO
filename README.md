# DCNNFORGO
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to Play Go

## Synopsis
In this project, the main aim is to obtain AI model that plays Go like professional human Go player. To achieve this aim deep convolutional neural networks are used in order to not use brute-force and seeks a stronger and more humanlike moves. These convolutional neural networks and other model elements, or functions are built-in functions of Knet.jl, https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl,. The model is tested by the data provided http://u-go.net/gamerecords/ after this data is prepared to have valid representation for Knet.jl. This data mapping from .sgf to tensor(4d arrays) is my own product using Julia. I also use JLD.jl,https://github.com/JuliaLang/JLD.jl, to save and load my data for each model.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
